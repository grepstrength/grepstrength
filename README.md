## Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst
I work as a CTI analyst, following the cyber threat intelligence life cycle to disseminate actionable intelligence to key stakeholders about emerging and established cyber threats. I have a strong adversarial mindset, and I spend as much time practicing offensive security as I do defensive security.
